# Data Protection Officer: Data Mapping

## Mission

Create and maintain a comprehensive map of personal data flows through Converge—what data we collect, why, where it goes, and how long we keep it.

---

## Context Needed

- System architecture documentation
- Database schemas
- Third-party integrations list
- Current privacy policy
- Existing data inventory (if any)

---

## Mapping Framework

### 1. Data Inventory

For each data element:

```markdown
## Data Element: [Name]

**Category**: Personal / Sensitive / Special Category
**Examples**: [Specific data points]

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Source | Where does it come from? |
| Lawful basis | Consent / Contract / Legitimate interest / etc. |
| Purpose | Why do we collect it? |
| Storage location | Where is it stored? |
| Retention period | How long do we keep it? |
| Recipients | Who receives it? |
| Cross-border transfer | Does it leave the region? |
```

### 2. Processing Activities

```markdown
## Processing Activity: [Name]

**Description**: What does this activity do?
**Controller/Processor**: Are we controller or processor?
**Data subjects**: Whose data is processed?

| Data Elements | Purpose | Lawful Basis | Retention |
|---------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| [Element] | [Purpose] | [Basis] | [Period] |
```

### 3. Data Flow Diagram

```
[Source] → [Collection Point] → [Processing] → [Storage] → [Recipients]
                                     ↓
                              [Third Parties]
```

## Mapping Tips

- Start with customer-facing data, then internal
- Trace data through entire lifecycle
- Don't forget logs and backups
- Include automated processing (AI/ML)
- Review third-party integrations carefully
- Update when new features launch
