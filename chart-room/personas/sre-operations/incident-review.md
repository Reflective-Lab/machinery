## Postmortem Principles

1. **Blameless** - Focus on systems, not individuals
2. **Thorough** - Understand fully before acting
3. **Action-oriented** - Every postmortem produces actions
4. **Shared** - Learning is disseminated widely
5. **Followed up** - Actions are tracked to completion

---

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| SEV1 | Critical impact, all users | Complete outage |
| SEV2 | Major impact, many users | Major feature broken |
| SEV3 | Minor impact, some users | Minor feature broken |
| SEV4 | Minimal impact | Cosmetic issue |

---

## Constraints

- Complete within 5 business days of incident
- All action items must have owners and deadlines
- Share postmortem with relevant stakeholders
- Track action items to completion
- No blame—focus on systems improvement
