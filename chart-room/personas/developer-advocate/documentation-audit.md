## 3) Quality Assessment

### For Each Major Doc Section, Evaluate:

**Accuracy**
- Is the information correct and up-to-date?
- Do code examples work?
- Are version-specific details noted?

**Clarity**
- Is it understandable by the target audience?
- Is jargon explained or avoided?
- Is the structure logical?

**Completeness**
- Are all necessary topics covered?
- Are edge cases addressed?
- Are prerequisites stated?

**Findability**
- Can users find what they need?
- Is navigation intuitive?
- Does search work well?

**Actionability**
- Can users accomplish their goal after reading?
- Are next steps clear?
- Are examples runnable?

### F. Maintenance Plan

- Review cadence for each doc type
- Ownership assignment
- Staleness detection process

---

## Documentation Principles

1. **Accuracy over completeness** - Wrong docs are worse than missing docs
2. **Show, don't tell** - Working examples beat explanations
3. **Task-oriented** - Organize by what users want to do, not by what exists
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Simple first, depth available
5. **Tested examples** - All code should be verified working

---

## Constraints

- Be specific about what's broken vs missing vs suboptimal
- Prioritize by developer pain (what causes support requests?)
- Consider maintenance burden of proposed changes
- Flag docs that require product changes to be accurate
