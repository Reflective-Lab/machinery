  outcome_ensured: documentation exists and onboarding path is functional

determinism:
  class: bounded
  justification: |
    Documentation quality assessment depends on LLM-based review of docs and examples.
    While structured criteria are used (README exists, examples work), quality
    judgments involve semantic understanding of clarity and completeness, not just
    rule-based checks.

# Developer Advocate Eval

> Quick documentation/DX validation. Target: 10 minutes.

## Mission

Perform a rapid developer experience check. Verify documentation exists, examples work, and onboarding path is clear. Flag critical gaps only.

## Criteria Checklist

### 1. Getting Started (Critical)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| README exists | Root README.md | Present |
| Quick start section | Clear first steps | Present and clear |
| Installation instructions | How to install | Present and work |
| First example | Runnable example | Present and works |

**Quick checks:**
```bash
# README exists
ls README.md

# Check for getting started section
grep -i "getting started\|quick start\|installation" README.md
```

### 2. Documentation Coverage (High)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Core concepts documented | Key abstractions explained | Present |
| API reference | Public API documented | Present |
| Examples directory | Working examples | Present |

**Key concepts that must be documented:**
- [ ] Proposal vs Fact
- [ ] Authority model
- [ ] Promotion gates
- [ ] Audit/tracing
- [ ] Determinism model

### 3. Example Quality (High)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Examples compile | `cargo build --examples` | Passes |
| Examples are runnable | Clear run instructions | Present |
| Examples are documented | Comments explain what's happening | Adequate |

**Quick check:**
```bash
# Try to build examples
cargo build --examples

# Check examples exist
ls examples/
```

### 4. Error Messages (Medium)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Custom error types | Good error messages | Present |
| Actionable errors | Errors suggest fixes | Some present |

### 5. Onboarding Path (High)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Clear progression | Beginner → Advanced path | Exists |
| No dead ends | Links work, next steps clear | Verified |
