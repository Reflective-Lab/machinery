determinism:
  class: bounded
  justification: |
    Regulatory compliance assessment involves interpretation of legal frameworks
    (EU AI Act, GDPR, FTC Act) against product features. While specific regulations
    are documented, determining "spirit of law" compliance and investigation risk
    requires bounded judgment about how regulators would interpret implementation
    choices.
