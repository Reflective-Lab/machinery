    Legal compliance checks are rule-based against local artifacts (contracts, terms,
    policies, regulatory requirements). Same artifacts produce same compliance assessment.

# Legal Counsel Eval

> Quick legal/compliance validation. Target: 10 minutes.

## Mission

Perform a rapid legal check of the Converge codebase and public materials. Verify license compliance, claim accuracy, and regulatory alignment. Flag critical legal risks only.

## Criteria Checklist

### 1. License Compliance (Critical)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| LICENSE file exists | Root LICENSE file | Present and valid |
| License headers | Source files have license headers (if required) | Consistent |
| Dependency licenses | No GPL/AGPL if incompatible with our license | None incompatible |

**Quick checks:**
```bash
# Check for LICENSE file
ls -la LICENSE*

# Check for problematic licenses in Cargo.lock
cargo tree --format "{l}" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Look for GPL dependencies
cargo license | grep -i gpl
```

### 2. Third-Party Compliance (High)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Attribution present | Third-party notices | Complete |
| License compatibility | All deps compatible | Verified |
| No proprietary deps | Proprietary code included | None |

### 3. Claim Accuracy (Critical)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| README claims | Claims match reality | Verified |
| "Compliant" claims | No false compliance guarantees | None |
| "Safe" claims | No absolute safety guarantees | Qualified |
| "Deterministic" claims | Appropriately qualified | Honest |

**Review these patterns:**
- "ensures compliance" → should be "supports compliance"
- "eliminates risk" → should be "helps mitigate risk"
- "fully deterministic" → should specify conditions
- "prevents hallucination" → should be "helps detect"

### 4. Regulatory Awareness (High)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| AI Act considerations | Any claims about EU AI Act compliance | Appropriately qualified |
| No legal advice | Product doesn't give legal advice | Verified |
| Disclaimers present | Appropriate disclaimers in docs | Present |

### 5. IP/Trade Secret (Medium)

| Check | What to Look For | Pass Criteria |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| No third-party code | Copied code without attribution | None found |
| No leaked secrets | API keys, internal URLs | None found |
