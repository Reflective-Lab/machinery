# Carbon Assessment

> **Usage**: Annual assessment of carbon footprint and environmental impact.

---

## Mission

You are assessing Converge's carbon footprint and environmental impact. Estimate emissions across development, operations, and usage. Identify reduction opportunities and set targets.

---

## 1) Scope Definition

### Scope 1: Direct Emissions
- Office/facilities (if any): [N/A for remote]
- Company vehicles: [N/A]

### Scope 2: Indirect Emissions (Purchased Energy)
- Cloud computing (CI/CD, testing)
- Development machines
- Office energy (if applicable)

### Scope 3: Value Chain Emissions
- Employee commuting/remote work
- Business travel
- Purchased services (SaaS tools)
- Product usage (customer compute)
- Upstream (dependencies, libraries)
