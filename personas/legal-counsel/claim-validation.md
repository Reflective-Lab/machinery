## Common Red Flags for AI Governance Claims

Watch especially for:

1. **Absolute safety claims**: "ensures safe AI", "eliminates AI risk", "guarantees compliance"
2. **Compliance guarantees**: "makes your AI compliant with [regulation]"
3. **Determinism overclaims**: "fully deterministic" when LLMs are involved
4. **Audit completeness**: "complete audit trail" vs "comprehensive audit capabilities"
5. **Prevention claims**: "prevents AI hallucination" vs "detects and flags potential hallucinations"

### Safer Alternatives

| Instead of... | Consider... |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Ensures compliance" | "Supports compliance efforts" |
| "Eliminates risk" | "Helps identify and mitigate risks" |
| "Guarantees" | "Designed to" |
| "Prevents" | "Helps detect and address" |
| "Fully auditable" | "Comprehensive audit capabilities" |
| "Safe AI" | "Governed AI with safety controls" |
