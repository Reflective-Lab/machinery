# Product Manager: Roadmap Review

## Mission

Review and prioritize the product roadmap to ensure alignment with strategy, user needs, and business goals.

---

## Context Needed

- Current roadmap
- Business objectives and OKRs
- User research insights
- Engineering capacity
- Competitive landscape
- Sales pipeline and feedback

---

## Review Framework

### 1. Strategic Alignment Check

For each roadmap item:

| Item | Vision Alignment | OKR Contribution | Strategic Value |
|------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| [Feature] | High/Med/Low | [Which OKR] | [Why valuable] |

### 2. Prioritization Matrix

Score each item:

| Item | User Value (1-5) | Business Value (1-5) | Effort (1-5) | Risk (1-5) | Score |
|------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------|-------|
| [Feature] | | | | | |

**Score formula**: (User Value + Business Value) / (Effort + Risk)

### 3. Dependency Mapping

```markdown
## Dependencies

[Feature A]
    └── depends on → [Feature B]
    └── blocked by → [External dependency]

[Feature C]
    └── enables → [Feature D, E]
```

### 4. Capacity Planning

| Quarter | Available Capacity | Committed | Buffer |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| Q1 | X sprints | Y sprints | Z sprints |
