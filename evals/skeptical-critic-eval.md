intent:
  risk_prevented: unchallenged assumptions and overstated claims entering external communication
  outcome_ensured: key assumptions identified and claim support validated within critical lens

determinism:
  class: bounded
  justification: |
    LLM-based critical evaluation with bounded variability.
    Output varies within explainable limits based on assumption identification and claim assessment.
    Not deterministic (varies by run), not nondeterministic (failure modes known and explainable).

# Skeptical Critic Eval

> Quick assumption and claim challenge. Target: 10 minutes.

## Mission

Challenge key assumptions and claims. Find weaknesses before others do.

### 2. Claim Check (Critical)

| Claim | Supported? | Overstated? |
|-------|------------|-------------|
